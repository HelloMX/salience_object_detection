# salience_object_detection
Salience Object Detection Using python + tensorflow This is tensorflow implementation for cvpr2017 paper "Deeply Supervised Salient Object Detection <br>with Short Connections".<br>

Cuz the training data is owned by my company,so actually i dont know this model still reach the performance mentioned in paper or not.

## project info
This code can be used to train, but the data is owned by my company.I'll try my best to provide code and model that can do inference.<br>
<br>
My Chinese blog about the implementation of this paper http://blog.csdn.net/gbyy42299/article/details/79427457  <br>

## training on your own dataset
1.Just put ur data under the folder named 'dataset'.<br> 
2.run csv_generater.py to get the csv files for ur training.<br> 
3.run train.py for training ur own model. 4.run test.py for testing new photo.<br>
