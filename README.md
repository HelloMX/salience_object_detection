# salience_object_detection
Salience Object Detection Using python + tensorflow This is tensorflow implementation for cvpr2017 paper "Deeply Supervised Salient Object Detection <br>with Short Connections".

## usage
This code can be used to train, but the data is owned by my company.I'll try my best to provide code and model that can do inference.<br>
<br>

1.Just put ur data under the folder named 'dataset'.<br> 
2.run csv_generater.py to get the csv files for ur training.<br> 
3.run train.py for training ur own model. 4.run test.py for testing new photo.<br>
